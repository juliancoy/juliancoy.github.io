<div class="paragraph">Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad	</div>

<div class="paragraph">Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,</div>
<div class="paragraph">Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,</div>
<div class="paragraph">Seeking the bubble reputation</div>
<div class="paragraph">Even in the cannon’s mouth. And then the justice,</div>

<div class="paragraph">With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,</div>

<div class="paragraph">Into the lean and slippered pantaloon	</div>
<div class="paragraph">With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,</div>
<div class="paragraph">His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide</div>

<div class="paragraph">I pray you, what is ’t o’clock?</div>

<div class="paragraph">You should ask me what time o’ day. There’s	</div>
<div class="paragraph">no clock in the forest.</div>
<div class="paragraph">ROSALIND    </div>
<div class="paragraph">Then there is no true lover</div>
<div class="paragraph">in the forest; else sighing every minute and</div>
<div class="paragraph">groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of</div>
<div class="paragraph">time as well as a clock.	</div>
<div class="paragraph">ORLANDO  </div>
<div class="paragraph">And why not the swift foot of time? Had not</div>
<div class="paragraph">that been as proper?</div>
<div class="paragraph">ROSALIND    </div>
<div class="paragraph">By no means, sir. Time travels in divers paces with </div>
<div class="paragraph">divers persons. </div>
<div class="paragraph">ORLANDO  </div>
<div class="paragraph">Where dwell you, pretty youth?	</div>
<div class="paragraph">ROSALIND   </div>
<div class="paragraph">With this shepherdess, my sister, here in the skirts of </div>
<div class="paragraph">the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat.</div>
<div class="paragraph">ORLANDO  </div>
<div class="paragraph">Are you native of this place?</div>
<div class="paragraph">ROSALIND    </div>
<div class="paragraph">As the cony that you see	</div>

<div class="paragraph">Your accent is something finer than you</div>
<div class="paragraph">could purchase in so removed a dwelling.</div>
<div class="paragraph">ROSALIND    </div>
<div class="paragraph">I have been told so of many. But indeed an old </div>
<div class="paragraph">religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was </div>
<div class="paragraph">in his youth an inland man, one that knew courtship </div>
<div class="paragraph">too well, for there he fell in love. I have heard him </div>
<div class="paragraph">read many lectures against it, and I thank God I am </div>
<div class="paragraph">not a woman, to be touched with so many giddy </div>
<div class="paragraph">offenses as he hath generally taxed their whole sex withal.</div>
<div class="paragraph">ORLANDO  </div>
<div class="paragraph">Can you remember any of the principal evils</div>
<div class="paragraph">that he laid to the charge of women?</div>
<div class="paragraph">ROSALIND   </div>
<div class="paragraph">There were none principal. They were all like one </div>
<div class="paragraph">another as halfpence are, every one fault seeming </div>
<div class="paragraph">monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it.</div>
<div class="paragraph">ORLANDO  </div>
<div class="paragraph">I prithee recount some of them.</div>
<div class="paragraph">ROSALIND   </div>
<div class="paragraph">No, I will not cast away my physic but on those that </div>
<div class="paragraph">are sick. There is a man haunts the forest that abuses </div>
<div class="paragraph">our young plants with carving “Rosalind” on their </div>
<div class="paragraph">barks, all, forsooth, deifying the name of Rosalind. If</div>
<div class="paragraph">I could meet that fancy-monger, I would give him </div>
<div class="paragraph">some good counsel, for he seems to have the </div>
<div class="paragraph">quotidian of love upon him.</div>
<div class="paragraph">ORLANDO  </div>
<div class="paragraph">I am he that is so love-shaked. I pray you tell</div>
<div class="paragraph">me your remedy.</div>
<div class="paragraph">ROSALIND   </div>
<div class="paragraph">There is none of my uncle’s	marks upon you. He </div>
<div class="paragraph">taught me how to know a man in love</div>
<div class="paragraph">ORLANDO  </div>
<div class="paragraph">I swear to thee, youth, by the hand of</div>
<div class="paragraph">Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he.</div>
<div class="paragraph">ROSALIND   </div>
<div class="paragraph">But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?</div>
<div class="paragraph">ORLANDO  </div>
<div class="paragraph">Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.</div>
<div class="paragraph">ROSALIND   </div>
<div class="paragraph">Love is merely a madness, </div>
<div class="paragraph">yet I profess curing it by counsel.</div>
<div class="paragraph">ORLANDO </div>
<div class="paragraph">Did you ever cure any so?</div>
<div class="paragraph">ROSALIND   </div>
<div class="paragraph">Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me </div>
<div class="paragraph">his love, his mistress,	and I set him every day to woo </div>
<div class="paragraph">me; at which time would I, being but a moonish </div>
<div class="paragraph">youth, grieve, be changeable, longing and liking, </div>
<div class="paragraph">proud, fantastical, apish, shallow, inconstant, full of </div>
<div class="paragraph">tears, full of smiles; for every passion something, and </div>
<div class="paragraph">for no passion truly anything, that I drave my suitor </div>
<div class="paragraph">from his mad humor of love to a living humor of </div>
<div class="paragraph">madness, which was to forswear the full stream of the </div>
<div class="paragraph">world and to live in a nook merely monastic. And </div>
<div class="paragraph">thus I cured him. I would cure you if you would but </div>
<div class="paragraph">call me Rosalind and come every day to my cote and </div>
<div class="paragraph">woo me.	</div>
<div class="paragraph">ORLANDO  </div>
<div class="paragraph">Now, by the faith of my love, I will. Tell me where it is.</div>
<div class="paragraph">ROSALIND   </div>
<div class="paragraph">Go with me to it, and I’ll show it you; Will you go?</div>
<div class="paragraph">ORLANDO  </div>
<div class="paragraph">With all my heart, good youth.</div>
<div class="paragraph">ROSALIND   </div>
<div class="paragraph">Nay, you must call me Rosalind.—Come, sister, will you go?</div>
<div class="paragraph">They exit.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Pardon me, dear Rosalind.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight.</div>
<div class="paragraph">Come, woo me, woo me, for now I am in a holiday </div>

<div class="paragraph">Am not I your Rosalind?</div>
<div class="paragraph">ORLANDO  </div>
<div class="paragraph">I take some joy to say you are because I</div>

<div class="paragraph">ROSALIND   </div>
<div class="paragraph">Well, in her person I say I will not have you.</div>

<div class="paragraph">OLIVER</div>
<div class="paragraph">Twice did he turn his back and purposed so,</div>
<div class="paragraph">But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,	</div>
<div class="paragraph">And nature, stronger than his just occasion,</div>
<div class="paragraph">Made him give battle to the lioness,</div>
<div class="paragraph">Who quickly fell before him; in which hurtling,</div>
<div class="paragraph">From miserable slumber I awaked.</div>
<div class="paragraph">CELIA    </div>

<div class="paragraph">But for the bloody napkin?</div>
<div class="paragraph">OLIVER  </div>
<div class="paragraph">By and by. here upon his arm	</div>
<div class="paragraph">The lioness had torn some flesh away,</div>
<div class="paragraph">Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted,</div>
<div class="paragraph">And cried in fainting upon Rosalind.</div>
<div class="paragraph">Brief, I recovered him, bound up his wound,</div>
<div class="paragraph">And after some small space, being strong at heart,</div>
<div class="paragraph">He sent me hither, stranger as I am,</div>
<div class="paragraph">To tell this story, that you might excuse</div>
<div class="paragraph">His broken promise, and to give this napkin</div>

<div class="paragraph">counterfeited. Heigh-ho.</div>
<div class="paragraph">OLIVER  </div>
<div class="paragraph">This was not counterfeit. There is too great</div>

<div class="paragraph">It’s tomorrow!</div>
<div class="paragraph">Enter Duke Senior, Amiens, Jaques, Orlando, Oliver,
and Celia dressed as Aliena. Also Touchstone and Audrey.</div>
<div class="paragraph">DUKE SENIOR</div>
<div class="paragraph">Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy</div>
<div class="paragraph">Can do all this that he hath promisèd?</div>
<div class="paragraph">ORLANDO</div>
<div class="paragraph">I sometimes do believe and sometimes do not,</div>
<div class="paragraph">As those that fear they hope, and know they fear.</div>
<div class="paragraph">Enter Rosalind dressed as Ganymede, Silvius, and Phoebe.</div>
<div class="paragraph">ROSALIND  </div>
<div class="paragraph">Patience once more whiles our compact is urged.</div>
<div class="paragraph">To Duke. </div>
<div class="paragraph">You say, if I bring in your Rosalind,</div>
<div class="paragraph">You will bestow her on Orlando here?</div>
<div class="paragraph">DUKE SENIOR</div>
<div class="paragraph">That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her.</div>
<div class="paragraph">ROSALIND</div>
<div class="paragraph"> to Orlando</div>
<div class="paragraph">And you say you will have her when I bring her?</div>
<div class="paragraph">ORLANDO</div>
<div class="paragraph">That would I, were I of all kingdoms king.	</div>
<div class="paragraph">ROSALIND </div>
<div class="paragraph">to Phoebe</div>
<div class="paragraph">You say you’ll marry me if I be willing?</div>
<div class="paragraph">PHOEBE</div>
<div class="paragraph">That will I, should I die the hour after.</div>
<div class="paragraph">ROSALIND </div>
<div class="paragraph">But if you do refuse to marry me,</div>
<div class="paragraph">You’ll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd?</div>
<div class="paragraph">PHOEBE </div>
<div class="paragraph">So is the bargain.	</div>
<div class="paragraph">ROSALIND</div>
<div class="paragraph"> to Silvius</div>
<div class="paragraph">You say that you’ll have Phoebe if she will?</div>
<div class="paragraph">SILVIUS </div>
<div class="paragraph">Though to have her and death were both one thing.</div>
<div class="paragraph">ROSALIND  </div>
<div class="paragraph">Keep you your word, O duke, to give your daughter,—</div>
<div class="paragraph">You yours, Orlando, to receive his daughter.—</div>
<div class="paragraph">Keep you your word, Phoebe, that you’ll marry me,</div>
<div class="paragraph">Or else, refusing me, to wed this shepherd.—</div>
<div class="paragraph">Keep your word, Silvius, that you’ll marry her</div>
<div class="paragraph">If she refuse me. And from hence I go	</div>
<div class="paragraph">To make these doubts all even.</div>
<div class="paragraph">Rosalind and Celia go behind a bush or something. As Duke and Orlando speak Rosalind’s Ganymede costume goes flying in the air over the bush, as does Celia’s Aliena costume.</div>
<div class="paragraph">DUKE SENIOR</div>
<div class="paragraph">I do remember in this shepherd boy</div>
<div class="paragraph">Some lively touches of my daughter’s favor.</div>
<div class="paragraph">ORLANDO</div>
<div class="paragraph">My lord, the first time that I ever saw him</div>
<div class="paragraph">Methought he was a brother to your daughter.	</div>

<div class="paragraph">In his own conduct, purposely to take</div>

<div class="paragraph">And to the skirts of this wild wood he came,</div>

<div class="paragraph">After some question with him, was converted</div>
<div class="paragraph">Both from his enterprise and from the world,</div>
<div class="paragraph">His crown bequeathing to his banished brother,</div>
